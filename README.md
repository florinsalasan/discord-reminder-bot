# discord-reminder-bot

Using streaks is a powerful motivator for a person to continue using a 
product or servicer. Unfortunately I've come up with too many streaks to 
keep track of so I am writing this. It is a discord bot in a personal server
where I can set a number of tasks I want to perform daily and be reminded of 
them periodically throughout the day.

## TODO:

- [ ] Everything, currently this is not a functioning project
- [x] Connect to discord api using discordgo package from bwmarrin
- [ ] Find a method of storing the list of reminders a user wants to be reminded of
- [ ] Setup the cron jobs for periodic reminders while tasks are not marked as complete
- [ ] Setup a way to mark tasks as complete for the day
- [ ] Setup a bot command to add and remove daily tasks to be reminded of
- [ ] Host it somewhere not on my computer to let it run all the time
